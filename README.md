## Brownian Motion
Brownian Motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collision with other atoms or molecules. Certain robot applications like exploration, coverage and swarm dynamics require the use of Brownian Motion. This challenge requires you to implement and simulate Brownian Motion type behavior on a robot.

## Steps
1. The robot is considered to be a point/circle.
1. The robot can be assumed to be present in a square boundary (arena).
1. The robot starts in the middle of the arena and moves straight at the start.
1. Mostly the robot would keep moving forward. On collision with the boundary, the robot would rotate for a random duration and then keep moving forward in the set direction.
